NestJS project example
=====

This repository is an example application for the [NestJS framework](https://nestjs.com/) that exposes a REST API and interacts with both [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).


Topics
---

This repository has two branches: `main` and `mongodb`. 
The `main` branch focuses on developing a web application using the NestJS framework with a particular emphasis on creating controllers, services, entities, and data transfer objects. It also covers a wide range of other topics such as handling request and response data, error handling, input data validation, configuration management, middleware, guards, interceptors, and testing. Furthermore it provides a solid foundation for building a robust and scalable web application using NestJS, which is a popular Node.js framework for building server-side applications.
The `mongodb` branch is primarily focused on implementing MongoDB functionalities and covers topics such as creating a Mongoose model, using it to access MongoDB, adding pagination, and implementing transactions. It also covers adding indexes to schemas for better performance.

- Use custom environment file paths
- Use schema validation
- Use the Config Service and custom configuration files
- Work with configuration namespaces and partial registration
- Configure dynamic modules asynchronously
- Use binding techniques
- Catch exceptions with filters
- Protect routes with guards
- Use metadata to build generic guards or interceptors
- Add pointcuts with interceptors
- Handle timeouts with interceptors
- Create custom pipes
- Add request logging with middleware
- Create custom param decorators
- Use the Swagger Module
- Enable CLI plugin

- Create a Mongoose Model
- Use a Mongoose Model to Access MongoDB
- Adding Pagination
- Use Transactions
- Adding Indexes to Schemas



Endpoints
---

The REST API is about coffees and includes a few endpoints. Some examples follow.

```
GET http://localhost:3000/coffees/flavors?limit={limit}&offset={offset}
```
```
GET http://localhost:3000/coffees/{id}
```
```
POST http://localhost:3000/coffees/ 
with JSON data in the request body:
{
  "name": "name",
  "brand": "brand",
  "flavors": [
    "flavor1",
    "flavor2"
  ]
}
```
```
PATCH http://localhost:3000/coffees/{id} 
with JSON data in the request body:
{
  "name": "new_name"
}
```
```
DELETE http://localhost:3000/coffees/{id}
```


Getting Started
---
